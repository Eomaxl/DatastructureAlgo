/**
 * Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.
 * A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element.
 * The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
 * Example 1: Input nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5], Output: 4
 * Example 2: Input nums = [0,3,2,5,4,6,1,1], Output: 7

// TC: O(n)  Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks the beginning of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in nums), the while loop can only run for n iterations throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm. This means that despite looking like
//O(nâ‹…. n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n+n)=O(n),
//
// SC: O(n) In order to set up O(1) containment lookups, we allocate linear space
//for a hash table to store the O(n) numbers in nums
