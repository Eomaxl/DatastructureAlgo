/**
 * Given a directed graph with V vertices labeled from 0 to V-1.
 * The graph is represented using an adjacency list where adj[i] lists all nodes adjacent to node i,
 * meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in adj[i].
 * A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges.
 * A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.
 * Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph in ascending order.
 *
 * Input: V = 7, adj= [[1,2], [2,3], [5], [0], [5], [], []]
 * Output: [2, 4, 5, 6]
